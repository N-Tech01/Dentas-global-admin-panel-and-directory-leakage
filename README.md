# Dentas Global Website Admin panel and Directory leakage Report

## Overview
Hello,  
My name is Navarath, and I would like to bring a potential security issue to your attention. I discovered this issue while exploring websites using Google Dorks as part of my learning in basic ethical hacking at CADD Centre. I am currently studying in the 8th standard.

## Description of the Issue
While searching through Google, I came across the **directory**,**admin control panel** of the Dentas Global website. This panel contains sensitive information about that site. I am unsure if this data is real or accessible to unauthorized users, so I reported it to the official team but i didn't get any response.Few days after, I checked that website but now it is not working.

The admin page was:  
`https://www.dentasglobal.com/eng/admin/php-jwt-main/src/`  

Unfortunately, this page no longer seems to be active, but I have attached screenshots of the panel for your reference.

## Steps
1. Use Google Dorks to search for sensitive sites (e.g., admin control panels).
2. Verify if they contain any sensitive or unauthorized information.
